Managing the state of the user is called as state management.

Actually Every web page is a stateless page, i.e. once we move forward from one page to another page, the previous page will be expired after certain time from client system.

Session is  a serverside statement management. 

HttpSession :- it is the class is used to identify session memory. 

getSession() :-  this method capture of sesion memory and stores into HttpSession Object. 

setAttribute(key, value) :-  to store value  into session.

Step 2 :-  In target page,  get value from url, as follows
		request.getParameter("variable")
